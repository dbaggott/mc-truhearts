## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-30

First stable release.

- Real (un-rounded) HP shown above the heart bar, with trailing-zero trim: `20`
  instead of `20.00`, `18.5` instead of `18.50`, `12.34` when precision warrants it.
- Absorption shown inline in gold (e.g. `+ 8`) when active, hidden when zero.
- Y-offset automatically clears the armor row and absorption-heart row so the
  readout never overlaps vanilla HUD elements.

Minecraft 26.2 with Fabric Loader 0.19.3+. Client-only — does nothing on a dedicated
server and isn't required there.
